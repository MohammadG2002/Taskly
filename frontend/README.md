# Taskly – Kanban Task Management

#### *Structured collaboration. Practical frontend architecture.*

Taskly is the second training project I built during my internship at ASAL Technologies and my first project developed within a collaborative team environment.

The application simulates a Kanban-based task management system using modern React architecture, mock data, and third-party libraries to replicate real-world workflows.

Designed with scalability, clean structure, and teamwork practices in mind.
