# Taskly – Kanban Task Management (Training Project)

Taskly is the second training project I built during my internship at **ASAL Technologies** and my first experience developing in a collaborative team environment.

The application simulates a Kanban-based task management system using modern React architecture, mock data, and third-party libraries to replicate real-world workflows.

Built with scalability, structure, and teamwork practices in mind.
